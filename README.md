# discord-bot

This is a separate discord bot for EngFrosh activities

It shares the same DB as the website at https://github.com/engfrosh/engfrosh and helps with many of its functions as well as extending its functionality in discord oriented areas.

This bot enabled easy censorship of swearing, member management via invites that are able to automatically assign roles and nicknames, and it enables quick setup and management of roles and channels for the planning teams.
